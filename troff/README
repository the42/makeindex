In this directory you find some files to test makeindex with troff

troff.ist		a sample style file
ixmac			defines macros to be used for indexing under troff
sample.txt		a sample troff document with embedded index commands
sample.idx		raw index file
sample.ind		the pre-formatted index file
makeind			a shell script that creates the raw index file (.idx),
			invokes makeindex which creates the final index file
			(.ind).  Note that
				makeind sample.txt
			will create sample.idx, sample.ilg, and sample.ind.

To typeset sample.txt as a Postscript file, use the following two commands
on a command prompt:

./makeind sample.txt
# This extracts the cross-referece information from sample.txt

troff -ms -Tps sample.txt sample.ind | grops > sample.ps
# Create a PostScript version of sample.txt

Opening sample.ps will show you a nicely formatted index using the
troff ms macro package. Using another macro package requires editing
the style file troff.ist
